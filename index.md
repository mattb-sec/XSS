# Introduction

Cross-site scripting is a way for attackers to steal information through some of the subtlest of means. What seems to be a regular text box on a website can turn into a vehicle for malicious code that attackers can use to harass people, or even steal their identities. This lab will first demonstrate the dangers of XSS by showing the huge effect one infected profile can have on a social media platform and then provide some potential countermeasures.
